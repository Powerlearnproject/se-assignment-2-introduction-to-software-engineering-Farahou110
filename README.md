1)Define Software Engineering:
2)Software Engineering refers to science that studies overall processes of program develpment that is: design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications:
3)how does software engineering differ from traditional programming? Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
 4)traditional programming refers to the conventional approach of writing code to create specific instructions for a computer to follow whereas software development refers to the process of developing a software through a process till it reaches the final user.
    a) Planning-It is completed by the senior members after held meeting with customer or owner of the software system. Quality assurance requirement, risk identification and feasibility report are the main outcomes of this phase:
    b) Requirement definition-specifications concerning the required software are made:
    c) Designing the Software Architecture-the software is sketched how it would appear:
    d) Building or Developing the Product-the software begins to be developed by checking the design and using requirements given.Coding is done using specific language:
    e) Testing-software is tested for errors and whether it satisfies user's need through a few consumers before it can be given off to the main market: (citation Shylesh, S. "A study of software development life cycle process models." National Conference on Reinventing Opportunities in Management, IT, and Social Sciences. 2017.)
5)Exlain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. Agile vs. Waterfall models
     Waterfall: an approach that involves steps (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
     agile: method  that involves testing in cycles whereby each cycke is tested untill it is proven successful.
6)Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Requirements Engineering:
     agile involves Iterative process model starts implementation with a subset of requirement specifications.Each iteration is added new functionality in the process and continuous until it is completed
     whereas in  waterfall ensures that until the one phase is not completed then next phase cannot start:
7)What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle-it refers to specifying the inputs and outputs of the software before it is developed.It helps to know the cost feasibility to plan easily and simplify development:
8)Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Testing in Software Engineering:
    design principle that aim at making the componenets to be more independent. in case of failure of a single components the other components are not affected:
9)Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
  unit software testing-involves checking the behavior of source code 
  integration testing-involves testing by converging all small units to a larger component that is then tested as a unified group:
  system testing-testing a completed software to ensure that it meets all its user needs
  acceptance testing-testing whether the software meets its business requirements:
10)Why is testing crucial in software development? Version Control Systems.
     Testing ensure that the software satisfies user needs and also ensures that errors are corrected to ensure maximum efficiency:
11)Version Control Systems refers to programs that help users to edit source codes. examples include teamforge,git(creating repositories),code co-op and darcus:
12)Software manager ensures that the project is planned and executed according to the design required.
    Challenges during software management include project plannning and estimation, communication, risk Control, project Control and monitoring, leadership, poor teamwork(Demir, K. A. (2009). A Survey on Challenges of Software Project Management. Software engineering research and practice, 2009(1), 579-585.):
13)Software maintenance refers to the process of ensuring that software meets user needs by correcting errors or making improvements to an existing software.
    types of software maintenance iclude Corrective Software Maintenance.
       Adaptive Software Maintenance-adapting to new changes
       Perfective Software Maintenance-improve it to a model that is more qualitative and quantitatuve could be improve accuracy or speed
       Preventive Software Maintenance- help curb future losses:
14)ethical issues include biased opinions, security cocerns of users such as user privacy, inaccurate data
    ethical issues can be reduced by adhering to the guidelines to avoid breaches, also ensuring that client needs are met on the contents to be made public or private:
